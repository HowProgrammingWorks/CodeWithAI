# Create Global Unique Identifier Generator (GSID)

> See implementation report: [REPORT.md](./REPORT.md)

## GSID Design Specifications

Generate globally unique id alternative to UUIDv4.
Try to do it even better. High performance is desired.

## Session Log

> Move your analysis and all other texts to REPORT.md
Moved all detailed analysis, implementation notes, and technical decisions to REPORT.md while keeping TASKS.md focused on task specification

> It looks like class GSID do everything, please respect SRP
Refactored GSID class to follow Single Responsibility Principle by separating concerns into dedicated classes:
- MachineId: Handles machine identification
- EntropyPool: Manages entropy pool for random bytes
- CounterManager: Handles counter logic for uniqueness
- Benchmark: Handles performance benchmarking
- GSID: Now focuses only on ID generation orchestration

> Do not create more js files, just put everything back into a single file
Consolidated all classes back into single gsid.js file while maintaining SRP through internal class organization:
- MachineId, EntropyPool, CounterManager, and Benchmark classes now internal to gsid.js
- Maintains clean separation of concerns within single file
- All functionality preserved with same performance characteristics

> Do not need benchmark class here. GSID should not have generateUUID. Why do we need generate and generateHybrid methods?
Simplified GSID design by removing unnecessary components:
- Removed Benchmark class (benchmarking moved to test file)
- Removed generateUUID method (use crypto.randomUUID() directly)
- Removed generateHybrid method (single generate() method is sufficient)
- GSID now focuses purely on generating unique IDs with clean, minimal API
